Hi friends, these CSVs are the output for the linear programming model only using vehicles that leave from VDC '3A'. Currently working on formulating an LP that works for all vehicles.

As you can see, the optimized routes for vehicles leaving from 3A go directly from 3A to the dealer, which makes sense. That means that none of these vehicles make stops at another VDC, when only considering vehicles leaving 3A. This will (hopefully) change when the model is applied to all vehicles
